# I-SynMed: Self-Supervised Learning Powered by Synthetic Data from Diffusion Models: Application to Medical Imagesü©∫ü§ñ

This project explores the use of generative models, particularly Denoising Diffusion Prbabilistic Model, to generate synthetic Chest X-ray data. It focuses on pretraining self-supervised learning (SSL) models on this synthetic data and evaluating their effectiveness using classifiers and segmentation tasks. The goal is to assess whether synthetic data can retain critical medical biomarkers and facilitate reliable downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/serag-ai/Syn-Med.git
```

### 2. Create and activate a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n env_name python=3.10
conda activate env_name
```

### 3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install denoising_diffusion_pytorch
pip install lightly
pip install scikit-learn
```

### 4. Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
cd Syn-Med
```

### 5. To train the Diffusion Model:
```bash
sh scripts/pretrain_ddpm.sh
```

### 6. To start generating the pretrained DDPM samples:
```bash
sh scripts/sample_ddpm.sh
```

### 7. To pretrain the Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model:
```bash
sh scripts/pretrain_dinovit16.sh
```

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Processed Dataset

For training the Diffusion Model (DDPM), we use the following two datasets:

- [NIH Chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data)
- [COVIDx CXR-4](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2)

As mentioned in the paper, we have generated around **120,000** unconditional synthetic samples. The dataset is publicly available and can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/serag-ai/Synthetic-X-Ray-Dataset).
